## Context
The assignment is a part of the course 'Statistical_Learning_for_Big_Data', course code MVE441 at Chalmers.

## Project
A clustering dataset (Q1_X.csv) is being provided consisting of 560 samples/observations and 974 columns/features.

The project is to determine the number of clusters in the dataset and find a method to visualise the best clustering.

## Responsibilities
- Perform an exploratory data analysis with the data in order to understand the dataset by summarizing their main characteristics, either statistically or visually.
- Implement dimensionality reduction on the data since the number of features is large relative to the number of observations.
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Data Standardization
- Use different clustering algorithms on the obtained principal components to obtain high quality clusters in the data.
  * K-means 
  * Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  * Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)

## Environment
Windows, Python.
