## Context
The assignment is a part of the course 'Statistical_Learning_for_Big_Data', course code MVE441 at Chalmers.

## Project 1: Clustering
We are provided with a clustering dataset containing 560 samples and 974 features.
The project is to determine the number of clusters in the dataset and find a way to visualise the best clustering.

## Responsibilities for project 1
- exploratory data analysis.
- dimension reduction.
- clustering algorithms.

## Project 2: Feature selection
We are provided with a regression dataset containing a response vector y of order n * 1 (Q2_y.csv) and two sets of features 𝐗1 of order n * p1  (Q2_X1.csv) and 𝐗2 of order n * p2 (Q2_X2.csv).
The project is to determine the most important predictors for the response 𝐲 using (A) only the features in 𝐗1 and then (B) both sets of features in 𝐗1 and 𝐗2 together (𝐗 = (𝐗1,𝐗2) of order n * (𝑝1+𝑝2)
and to explain the difference between the results obtained from (A) and (B).

## Responsibilities for project 2
- exploratory data analysis.
- feature selection.

## Environment
Windows, Python.
